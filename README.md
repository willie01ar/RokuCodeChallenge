# To Build

## Via Python

There is no build process for Roku apps.  Just zip up the entire project (excluding the rather large .git directory).  Make sure the zip process leaves the *manifest* file in the root path (the OS X archive command frequently doesn't do this correctly).  

There's a convenience tool for doing this from the command line, which we recommend (see [github page](https://github.com/hulu/roku-dev-cli) for usage).    

```shell
pip3 install roku-dev-cli
```
